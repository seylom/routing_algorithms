About our work:

The provided source code follows the MP guidelines and provides implementation
of both link state and distance vector routing algorithms.


1- cd to the directory containing the files
2- enter ./manager <topology file> <message file>
3- enter the following lines depending on the algorithm

./distvec manager_host  

or 
./linkstate manager_host

where manager_host is the host address.


IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

We make use of pthreads to handle the communication between nodes themselves
and the manager node communication.

node <-> node    :  UDP
node <-> manager :  TCP



NOTES
-----

We had to resort to the use of timers to ensure message would be displayed in the right
order and the data could be received in a correct order by the nodes.
